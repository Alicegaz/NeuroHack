# NeuroHack
The project for the Neuro Hackathon. VAE for the model validation in the Melanoma prediction application. Used VAE to figure out the distribution of the training data and later at the inference time filter out those samples in the test set that deviate much from the distribution.

## Get the dataset
First get the data from https://github.com/GalAvineri/ISIC-Archive-Downloader

```
git clone https://github.com/GalAvineri/ISIC-Archive-Downloader
```
